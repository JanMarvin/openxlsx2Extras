The goal of openxlsx2Extras is to extend the functionality of the {openxlsx2} R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of openxlsx2Extras like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/openxlsx2Extras")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to use `wb_save_ext()` to set a filename based on the workbook title:

```{r}
library(openxlsx2)
library(openxlsx2Extras)

withr::with_tempdir({
  wb_workbook(
    title = "Title used for output file"
  ) |>
    wb_add_worksheet() |>
    wb_save_ext()

  fs::dir_ls()
})
```
